- Generate models for alignments of N>6

- Output warnings if something is out of range and result is thus extrapolated

- Include better treatment of missing data (sequences with too much gaps and Ns)

- Include sliding window options

- Reconsider output format

- Make user interface more friendly (long options...)

- read position information from Clustal file

- Read also aligned fasta format

- include graphical output of consensus structures for hits found

- include graphical output illustrating score SCI/z significance

- include shuffling option for negative controls

- include significance estimation by scoring random alignments

- compile default models into RNAz making strict dependence on enviroment variable obsolete

- include support for single sequences and Lfold local folding
