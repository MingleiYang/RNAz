- Check option number formats: eg. float instead of integers for mean pairwise identitties in some scripts
- Handle unkown format case in RNAz.c line 163 (switch statement)
- rnazWindow.pl: document feature that filters alignments out of RNAz range, add switch for this behaviour
- crashes if you feed maf without "a" but starting with "score=0", should say "I don't know" instead
- seg-fault if only one sequence in alignment
- seg-fault if gap only sequence
- seg-fault: see japanese e-mail with solution
-  $RNAz::version appears unresolved in output of html pages (seen in Leipzig protocols)
- rnazCluster: see e-mail version of Sven Findeiss
- seg fault on my laptop if running RNAz -s examples/tRNA.aln
- set fault on paml format (as generated by evolver), should say "unknown format" instead
-RNA.c l. 715 warning only GC, fix typo!
- rnazBlast.pl: --blast-dir has no effect. BLASTDB must be set somewhere. 
- rnazCluster.pl --  $minStart=99000000; too low, use MAXINT or similar (phaesent mail)
- A/U issues in rangeWarn() in RNAz.pm/rnazWindows.pl, Dominic mail of 07/28/08
- If rnazFilter.pl is fed with some unknown file, like for example the raw RNAz output instead of the 
  rnazCluster.pl, it says "you have an error in your filter statement". See mail from ariane.machado@gmail.com received 19/11/08
