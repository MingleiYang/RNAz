.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
RNAz detects stable and conserved RNA secondary structures in multiple
sequence alignments. RNAz calculates two independent scores for structural
conservation (the structure conservation index SCI) and for thermodynamical
stability (the z\-score). High structural conservation (high SCI) and
thermodynamical stability (negative z\-scores) are typical features of
functional RNAs (e.g. non\-coding RNAs or cis\-acting regulatory
elements). RNAz uses both scores to classify a given alignment as
functional RNA or not. It uses a support vector machine classification
procedure which estimates a class\-probability which can be used as
convenient overall\-score.

.LP 
.TP 
\fBRNAZDIR\fP
.LP 
Pointing to the directory with the support vector machine model files (*.model). In a default installation on a BASH shell the variable can be set using this command: 
.LP 
export RNAZDIR=/usr/local/share/RNAz/models 
.LP 
Modify this command according to your shell and custom installation path.
